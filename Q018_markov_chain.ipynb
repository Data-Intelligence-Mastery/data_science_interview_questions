        "Suppose you're working for a car rental company, looking to model potential location distribution of their cars at major airports. The company operates in LA, SF, and San Jose. Customers regularly pickup a car in one of these 3 cities and drop it off in another. The company is looking to compute how likely it is that a given car will end up in a given city. You can model this as a Markov chain (where each time step corresponds to a new customer taking the car). The transition probabilities of the company's car allocation by city are as follows:\n",

        " San Jose | 0.2 | 0.1 | 0.4 \n",
        "\n",
        "As shown, the probability a car stays in SF is 0.6, the probability it moves from SF to LA is 0.2, SF to San Jose is 0.2, etc.\n",

        "\n",
        "The probability of a car ending up in SF is depend on the probability of the car start from either SF or LA or SJ based on the Markov Chain 'memoryless' property.\n",

        "\n",
        "P4(->SF) = (P1 + P2 + P3) / 3 = 0.33\n",
        "\n",
        "So the probablity of a car start in SF but move to LA is \n",
